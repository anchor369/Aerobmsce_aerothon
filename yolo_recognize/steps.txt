Sure! Here's a **consolidated summary of all the steps** you followed to build your **drone-based disaster detection system using YOLOv8**:

---

## âœ… Consolidated Workflow: Drone-Based Disaster Detection using YOLOv8

---

### **1. Dataset Preparation**

* âœ… Collected 5 categories of disaster images:

  * `collapsed_building`, `fire`, `flooded`, `traffic_accident`, `normal`
* âœ… Manually labeled images (starting with `traffic_accident`) using [**makesense.ai**](https://www.makesense.ai)
* âœ… Exported labels in **YOLO format**
* âœ… Matched `.jpg` images with corresponding `.txt` annotation files

---

### **2. Dataset Structuring for YOLOv8**

Organized dataset into YOLOv8-compatible format:

```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train/
â”œâ”€â”€ labels/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train/
data.yaml
```

* âœ… Created `data.yaml` with:

  ```yaml
  train: dataset/images/train
  val: dataset/images/train
  nc: 1
  names: ['traffic_accident']
  ```

---

### **3. Model Training (Locally)**

* âœ… Installed `ultralytics` via pip

* âœ… Trained YOLOv8n model locally using:

  ```bash
  yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
  ```

* âœ… Training output saved at:

  ```
  runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt
  ```

---

### **4. Model Testing and Prediction**

* âœ… Used trained model to predict on images:

  ```bash
  yolo task=detect mode=predict model=path/to/best.pt source=dataset/images/train
  ```

* âœ… Results (with bounding boxes) saved to:

  ```
  runs/detect/predict/
  ```

---

### **5. Real-Time Detection from Webcam**

* âœ… Wrote Python script using OpenCV to detect disasters in real time:

  ```python
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  import cv2

  model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

  while True:
      ret, frame = cap.read()
      results = model(frame)
      cv2.imshow("Detection", results[0].plot())
      if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
          break

  cap.release()
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  ```

---

### **6. Project Documentation**

* âœ… Created full project **report** summarizing objectives, methodology, results, and future scope
* âœ… Generated a clean, **black-and-white flowchart** for project flow:

  * Image Input from Drone â†’ Preprocessing â†’ YOLOv8 Inference â†’ Postprocessing â†’ Detected Disasters

---

## ðŸ“¦ Final Deliverables

* `best.pt` (trained YOLOv8 model)
* Full labeled dataset
* Real-time detection script
* Project Report
* Flowchart

* A zipped folder of the entire structure
* A PDF report with visuals
* A ready-to-pitch PowerPoint version of this summary

We can now extend this to **multi-class disaster detection** or deploy it on **Raspberry Pi/Drones** next!
